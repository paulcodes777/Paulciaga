Paulciaga E-Commerce Demo is a personal front-end e-commerce project I built to practice web development and showcase my skills. The site uses HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 5 to create a clean, responsive shopping experience and includes features such as a home page, menâ€™s hoodies product page, simple demo checkout form (no real payment processing), favicon, responsive design for desktop and mobile, and a well-organized project structure with asset management. This project serves as part of my personal learning journey and portfolio, demonstrating my understanding of front-end design, website structure, and responsive development.

In my Paulciaga project, I designed and built a full multi-page front-end e-commerce demo site using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5. I created a clean homepage with navigation links, including dropdown menus for categories. I added a Menâ€™s Hoodies product page that displays products with consistent styling and image formatting. I implemented a demo checkout page featuring form fields for customer and card information. I customized the favicon for brand identity and applied Bootstrap classes for a responsive design across devices. I used utility classes and CSS for margins, padding, borders, and image scaling. I learned how to structure pages with reusable Bootstrap components, and I practiced creating consistent headers, footers, and navigation across pages. I created a simple AI chatbot feature as an interactive demo assistant, allowing users to ask basic questions and receive automated responses, simulating customer support on the site. I included a plan for a 404 page and explored good practices for clean project file organization. I also improved user experience with simple design enhancements and considered adding future features like GitHub Pages deployment. Throughout the project, I strengthened my understanding of responsive layouts, navigation bar logic, dropdowns, basic form handling in HTML, and integrating interactive JavaScript components.
