Paulciaga E-Commerce Demo is a personal front-end e-commerce project I built to practice web development and showcase my skills. The site uses HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 5 to create a clean, responsive shopping experience and includes features such as a home page, menâ€™s hoodies product page, simple demo checkout form (no real payment processing), favicon, responsive design for desktop and mobile, and a well-organized project structure with asset management. This project serves as part of my personal learning journey and portfolio, demonstrating my understanding of front-end design, website structure, and responsive development.
