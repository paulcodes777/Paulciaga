Paulciaga E-Commerce Demo is a personal front-end e-commerce project I built to practice web development and showcase my skills. The site uses HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 5 to create a clean, responsive shopping experience and includes features such as a home page, menâ€™s hoodies product page, simple demo checkout form (no real payment processing), favicon, responsive design for desktop and mobile, and a well-organized project structure with asset management. I designed and built a full multi-page front-end e-commerce demo site using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5, creating a clean homepage with navigation links, including dropdown menus for categories. I added a Menâ€™s Hoodies product page that displays products with consistent styling and image formatting and implemented a demo checkout page featuring form fields for customer and card information. I customized the favicon for brand identity and applied Bootstrap classes for responsive design across devices, using utility classes and CSS for margins, padding, borders, and image scaling. I structured pages with reusable Bootstrap components, practiced creating consistent headers, footers, and navigation across pages, and created a simple AI chatbot feature as an interactive demo assistant, allowing users to ask basic questions and receive automated responses, simulating customer support on the site. I explored good practices for clean project file organization, and improved user experience with simple design enhancements. I also considered deploying the site with GitHub Pages as a future step. Throughout this project, I gained and strengthened skills in front-end web development, responsive design, Bootstrap framework usage, HTML and CSS best practices, file and asset management, basic JavaScript for interactivity, form creation and input handling, version control concepts, and overall project planning and execution for small-scale web applications.
